# NWSPK Events

Newspeak House is a residential incubator and members' club in East London. It's financially supported by Commercial Hires of it's main space, but members can book the space for free for mission-aligned events.

What follows is a list of stakeholders of Newspeak Events, and what their needs from the system are:

## High Level User Needs

1. Members

 - a) Can propose mission-aligned events [x]
 - b) Can choose to be notified of new events [x]
    - Currently both the above is done through [HackPad](https://hackpad.com/Newspeak-House-Events-Calendar-uNKMeHocJE9)
 - c) Can view events in a calendar app of their choice (using an open standard calendar feed) [ ]
 
2. Newspeak Staff

 - b) Can view all information about any booked event [x]
 - c) Can view the information they need to accept or reject an event proposal [x]
    - Currently all the above is done through a Google Spreadsheet
    
3. Commercial Clients

// Above are project Outcomes... The MVP system should be achieving these Outcomes. Can we link issues to the Outcomes??

## Other notes on the system and space

 - Some events book multiple spaces
 - Equipment and staff also gets booked (sometimes with events, sometimes not)
 - Double booking some spaces is allowed
 - Events can be private or public
 - Booking time default: Day or time, can be changed
 - Certain assets need prerequisites (like PA needs staff supervision)
 - Members can only book assets up to a month in advance: This is to avoid taking up potential commercial bookings
